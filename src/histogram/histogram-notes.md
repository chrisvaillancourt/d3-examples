# Histogram Notes

- Horizontal position represents a discrete metric
  - This metric is often a binned continuous metric
- Height represents a discrete metric (the count of data points that fall within each bucket)
- Use when you wnat to look at the variation of values for a single metric
- There are 5 basic types of distributions:
  - Normal: centered around the mean
  - Skewed right: a value is more likely to reside in the upper half of values
  - Skewed left: a value is more likely to reside in the lower half of values. Often resulting from a lower bound where values can't drop below
  - Bi-modal: two clear peaks
  - Symmetric: no clear peaks
