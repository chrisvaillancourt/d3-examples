# Scatter Plot

- Good for visualizing the relationships between metrics
- horizontal and vertical positioning of a continuous metric
- Important to keep the chart square so the range is consistent for both metrics
- We can add a line of best fit to help show how two metrics might correlate
- We can add a color dimension to differentiate between categories of data
