# Box plot notes

- Good for showing discrete / binned continuous metrics
  - Usually, over time or in relation to another metric
- Each box shows the distribution of values for a category
- Horizontal position represents a discrete metric
- Vertical position of each box & whisker represents a continuous metric
- Height of each vox and whisker represents a continuous metric
- Middle line represents the median
- The Box covers values from the 25th percentile to the 75th percentile
- Whiskers extent 1.5x the inter-quartile range (IQR) from the median in both directions
  - IQR: the difference between the 25th and 75th percentile
- Outliers that fall beyond the 75th & 25th percentile are shown as dots
