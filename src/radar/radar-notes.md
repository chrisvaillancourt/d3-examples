# Radar Chart

- Consist of at least three axes, with each axis corresponds with a different metric
- Not helpful for making exact measurements
- Great for comparing lots of charts with lots of metrics
- One radar chart represents a data profile. You can then compare the profiles to identify similarities and differences
- Methods to presenting a multitude of profiles:
  - Show multiple polygons of varying colors, all on the same chart.
    - Good when the number of profiles is <5.
  - Show one chart with a toggle to change profiles.
    - Good for instances when you want to focus on one profile at a time. Allows you to add more contextual information beside each chart
  - Small multiples of radar charts
    - Good for comparing >5 profiles with no extra info
